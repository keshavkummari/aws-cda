1. AWS Batch
AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. 
Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. 
AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure.

2. Amazon EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizeable computing capacity—literally, servers in Amazon's data centers—that you use to build and host your software systems.

3. Amazon ECR
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

4. Amazon ECS
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

5. Amazon EKS
Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes clusters.  

6. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. 
AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. 
You simply upload your application, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

7. AWS Lambda
With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You pay only for the compute time you consume—there’s no charge when your code isn’t running. 
You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service—all with zero administration. 
Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. 
You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

8. Amazon Lightsail
Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers. 
Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly – a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP – for a low, predictable price.

9. AWS Serverless Application Repository
With AWS Serverless Application Repository, you can quickly find and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. 
You can browse applications by category, or search for them by name, publisher, or event source. 
To use an application, you simply select it, configure required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. 

As a serverless application developer, you can also easily publish applications, sharing them across teams and organizations and with other AWS users. 
To publish serverless applications, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to upload the code, along with a simple manifest file.  

10. Amazon VPC
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources into a virtual network that you've defined. 
This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
