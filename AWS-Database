1. Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. 
You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. 
Amazon DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the amount of data stored, 
while maintaining consistent and fast performance.

2. Amazon ElastiCache
Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale distributed in-memory cache environments in the AWS Cloud. 
It provides a high performance, resizable, and cost-effective in-memory cache, while removing the complexity associated with deploying and managing a distributed cache environment. 
ElastiCache works with both the Redis and Memcached engines.
